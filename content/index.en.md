This hands-on workshop provides a guide to building EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) clusters using Terraform Blueprints and ArgoCD. It is designed for engineers, developers, and teams who are responsible for creating and maintaining EKS infrastructure and applications. 

Throughout the workshop, participants will learn how to leverage Terraform Blueprints to automate the provisioning and configuration of EKS clusters and related resources. Terraform Blueprints provide a robust framework for defining cluster settings, networking, IAM roles, and more as code. This enables consistent and repeatable EKS deployments.

The workshop will also demonstrate managing EKS configurations and deployments using ArgoCD. ArgoCD is a GitOps based continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that automates syncing application definitions from Git repositories into the cluster. Using ArgoCD alongside Terraform Blueprints, participants will learn a GitOps workflow for declaring both their infrastructure and applications.
